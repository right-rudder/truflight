## Your First Helicopter Flight Lesson

A first helicopter flight is exciting, but it is also structured and safety-focused. Many students arrive with questions about what will happen and what they need to know.

At **TruFlight Academy in Howe, Texas**, first flights are designed to help students feel comfortable, informed, and supported.

## Before the Helicopter Leaves the Ground

Every lesson begins with a **preflight briefing**. Your instructor will explain:

- How the helicopter works
- Basic safety rules
- What each control does
- How today’s flight will go

You will also walk around the aircraft to learn how pilots check for safety before every flight.

## In the Pilot’s Seat

During your first flight, you will sit in the pilot’s seat next to an instructor. Once airborne, many students are surprised by how smooth helicopter flight feels.

Under instructor guidance, you may:

- Hold the controls
- Practice gentle movements
- Learn how the helicopter stays stable in the air

Everything happens at a calm pace, with safety as the top priority.
