## Medical Requirements for Helicopter Pilots

Before flying solo or earning a helicopter license, pilots must meet FAA medical standards. These requirements help ensure pilots can operate aircraft safely.

At **TruFlight Academy in Howe, TX**, students are guided through these requirements early in training so there are no surprises later.

## FAA Medical Certificate Types

There are three main FAA medical certificates:

- **Third Class Medical**, commonly used for private pilots
- **Second Class Medical**, required for most commercial pilots
- **First Class Medical**, typically used by airline pilots

Most helicopter students begin with a **Third Class Medical**.

## What the Medical Exam Includes

An FAA medical exam is completed by an Aviation Medical Examiner and usually checks:

- Vision and hearing
- Heart and general health
- Medical history review

The exam focuses on safety and fitness to fly, not perfection.

## When to Get Your Medical

Many students complete their medical exam early in training. This helps avoid delays later, especially before solo flight.

Your instructor can help you decide the best time to schedule the exam based on your training goals.

## Medical Concerns and Questions

Common concerns include vision correction, past injuries, or medications. In many cases, these do not prevent flying.

Open communication with your instructor helps ensure training stays on track and safe.
