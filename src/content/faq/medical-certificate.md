You need at least a Third Class FAA Medical Certificate to begin helicopter pilot training. This medical exam is conducted by an FAA-authorized aviation medical examiner (AME). The medical certificate verifies that you meet the health standards required for safe flight operations.

We can help you find a local AME and guide you through the medical certification process. Most healthy individuals can obtain a medical certificate without issues.
