Yes! We offer mobile helicopter training where we fly to you for your lessons. This service is available for students at airports where we have multiple students training on the same day, allowing the convenience fee to be split between participants. The convenience fee covers the ferry flight costs to and from your location. We're based just north of McKinney and can arrange training at suitable airports in the Dallas area.
