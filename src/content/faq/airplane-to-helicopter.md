Yes! Having an airplane license can actually be helpful when transitioning to helicopters. We offer helicopter add-on courses for pilots who already hold fixed-wing certificates:

- **Private Helicopter Add-On**: For private airplane pilots
- **Instrument Helicopter Add-On**: For instrument-rated airplane pilots
- **Commercial Helicopter Add-On**: For commercial airplane pilots

Your existing aeronautical knowledge and flying experience will be valuable, though you'll need to learn the unique handling characteristics and flight controls of helicopters.
