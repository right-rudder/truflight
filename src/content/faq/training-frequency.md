For optimal progress, we recommend:

- **Beginners**: 2-3 times per week for consistent skill building
- **Advanced students**: 3-5 times per week to maintain momentum
- **Working professionals**: Flexible scheduling with intensive weekend sessions
- **Accelerated programs**: Daily flights for rapid completion

Regular, consistent training is key to retaining skills and progressing efficiently. Gaps longer than a week between flights may require review sessions. We work with each student to create a schedule that fits their lifestyle and learning goals.
