Helicopters and airplanes have fundamental differences:

**Helicopters:**

- Can hover, take off and land vertically
- More complex controls (collective, cyclic, anti-torque pedals)
- Greater precision required for control
- Can land in small spaces
- Lower cruise speeds but more versatile

**Airplanes:**

- Require runways for takeoff and landing
- Simpler control system (elevator, ailerons, rudder)
- Higher cruise speeds and fuel efficiency
- Better for long-distance travel

Both require different training approaches and skill sets, making helicopter flying a unique and rewarding challenge.
