The cost of helicopter pilot training varies depending on the license level you're pursuing. Our Private Pilot License (PPL) program typically costs significantly less than a 4-year college degree, making professional pilot training accessible and affordable. For specific pricing on private pilot, instrument rating, or commercial helicopter training, please contact our Dallas flight school for a personalized quote. We offer flexible payment plans and financing options to make your helicopter pilot certification more affordable.
