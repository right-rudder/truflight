The timeline depends on the license level and your training frequency:

- **Private Pilot License (PPL)**: Typically 3 months training 2-3 times per week
- **Instrument Rating**: 6 months to 1 year
- **Commercial Pilot License (CPL)**: 3 months training 3-5 times per week

Your progress depends on factors like weather, personal availability, and individual learning pace. We work with each student to create a training schedule that fits their needs and goals.
