          Becoming a helicopter pilot can easily lead to a very rewarding and
          lucrative career. (Not to mention you sound cool at parties) One big
          positive about working in the aviation field, is that when applying
          for jobs hours in the aircraft are what they look at most. If you're a
          high schooler looking to work something other than retail when you
          graduate, this is the job for you! Additionally, if college isn't your
          thing, <a

            class="text-primary-500 font-semibold hover:underline"

          > is definitely a career for you.

          You can start logging hours as soon as you hit high school. You have
          to be 16 to solo, 17 to take your <a

          >, and 18 to take your <a

      Cost of getting your CFI vs College
    </h2>

    <p class="tracking-wider text-gray-700 lg:text-lg">
      The average cost of getting a college degree in the United States,
      including books and supplies, is $35, 551 A YEAR. This means a 4-year
      degree costs about $142,000. Most careers that require a college degree
      can take years to pay for itself. At TruFlight we chose our <a

        class="text-primary-500 font-semibold hover:underline"
        >helicopter (Guimbal's Cabri G2)</a
      > specifically to save our students as much money as possible in the safest,
      easiest to transition, training helicopter available.
    </p>
    <p class="tracking-wider text-gray-700 lg:text-lg">
      Bottom line, including the cost of your FAA Exams (3), check rides (3),
      flight hours (150hrs), and ground school time (about 100hrs) TruFlight
      Academy can get you to your <a
        href="/pilot-training/certified-flight-instructor"
        class="text-primary-500 font-semibold hover:underline">CFI</a
      > for approximately half the cost of a college degree. Helicopter pilots are
      in high demand, once you have your
