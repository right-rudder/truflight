      Why We Choose the Cabri G2
    </h2>

    <p class="tracking-wider text-gray-700 lg:text-lg">
      Our helicopters are what sets us apart from other flight schools. Most
      jobs, outside of flight instruction, will require competence in a turbine
      helicopter. Turbine helicopters cost significantly more to operate, which
      is why training is done in piston helicopters. The Cabri G2 is designed to
      make turbine transition practically seamless. Its full glass panel, its
      engine instrumentation, and its general operating procedures mimic closely
      a turbine helicopter.
    </p>
    <p class="tracking-wider text-gray-700 lg:text-lg">
      Guimbal's Cabri G2 was certified by the FAA in 2015 with transition and
      safety in mind. The other training helicopters available were certified as
      far back as 1938. The newest company (other the Guimbal) certified their
      base helicopter designs in 1979. Why do I mention certification dates?
      It's very hard to certify an aircraft and once certified, the manufacturer
      is forced to abide by all the certification specifications. The Guimbal,
      being certified in 2015, means it has the most up to date materials and
      design on the market.
