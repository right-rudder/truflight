            "My passion in life has always been flying. My earliest memory, at
            the age of four, is sitting in a helicopter at my uncle’s change of
            command (a formal military ceremony) thinking, "This is the coolest
            thing I have ever seen!" However, my obsession truly started while I
            listened to my Grandpa’s riveting stories of flying in the Pacific
            Theater during World War II."

          About Me
        </h2>
        <p class="tracking-wider text-gray-700 lg:text-lg">
          I received my private license as a teenager. Starting as early as
          2010, I have had extensive, hands-on, experience as a Certified Rotor
          Flight Instructor (CFI). Initially, I taught helicopter students with
          Canyon State Aero. In 2014, I commissioned in the Army as an
          active-duty Aviation officer. During my first four years in the Army,
          I was directly responsible for 5 Blackhawk helicopters and their
          crews. I was also in charge of coordinating maintenance efforts, as
          well as, conducting Flight trainings, ensuring Soldier welfare, and
          the HR requirements of the crews. I’ve spent the last four years
          working with national agencies, international agencies, and militaries
          to coordinate aviation efforts domestically and across 3 continents.
        </p>
        <p class="tracking-wider text-gray-700 lg:text-lg">
          After an honorable discharge from active Army Aviation service, I’ve
          decided to pursue my dream of teaching others, so that they can share
          in my passion. I look forward to sharing the joy I have felt since I
          was a toddler and the skills I've learned while flying military
          helicopters.
