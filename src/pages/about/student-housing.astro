        <p class="tracking-wider text-gray-700 lg:text-lg">
            To support students traveling from outside the local area, TruFlight Academy
            offers convenient on-site and nearby student housing options designed to make
            training as focused and stress-free as possible. Our housing solutions allow
            students to stay close to the training environment, minimizing commute time
            and maximizing time spent learning and flying.
            </p>

            <p class="tracking-wider text-gray-700 lg:text-lg">
            Student housing accommodations are selected with comfort, safety, and
            practicality in mind. Options typically include fully furnished living
            spaces, shared common areas, and essential amenities to support day-to-day
            life during training. Whether students are enrolled in short-term programs or
            extended courses, housing arrangements are designed to fit a variety of
            training schedules.
            </p>

            <p class="tracking-wider text-gray-700 lg:text-lg">
            Living alongside fellow students fosters a strong sense of community and
            collaboration. Many students find that sharing housing with peers creates an
            environment of mutual support, study, and camaraderie, extending the learning
            experience beyond the flight line and into everyday life.
            </p>

            <p class="tracking-wider text-gray-700 lg:text-lg">
            Availability, pricing, and housing details may vary based on enrollment and
            program length. Our team is happy to assist prospective and current students
            with housing questions and help determine the best option to support a smooth
            and successful training experience at TruFlight Academy.
